# Bird species classifier
Deep Learning project based on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) of 50 582 birds picture ( $224 \times 224 \times 3$ ) to classify birds species

Here are the [guidelines](https://centralesupelec.edunao.com/pluginfile.php/171469/course/section/25973/intro_projets.pdf) for the project.

The [related paper](https://www.overleaf.com/project/61d1add68f5dca5cc5560cb5) is currently in progress on Overleaf.

TODO :
1. State of the art
2. Gather NN architectures
3. Experimentation planning and procedure
